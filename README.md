# Archlive
ArchLive is a custom archiso that has a DE or WM preinstalled, so you can have the archwiki open right next to 
your terminal. Basically its a comfier install iso. It also has possibility
to be used as a Rescue pendrive. It includes tools like "Grub rescue", from MX linux and gparted.

TLDR; ArchLive is a live iso with a Desktop Enviroment 

Current 3 main iso's:
 * Openbox
 * Xfce
 * KDE Plasma
 
Choose the iso to your hardware power or preference.
Also the beta isos are mostly stable we just needed a naming scheme, so feature crowd and then start testing the features.

## Grub Rescue
Szybet added grub rescue which allows you to boot to systems (Windows also), or just efi files.
Its good for troubleshooting.
## How to
You need those packages and a Arch based distro:
arch-install-scripts
bash
dosfstools
e2fsprogs
libisoburn
squashfs-tools

Then just ran the .build with root privileges in the same directory as the rest of files.
If you are on a non Arch based distro, just download the Iso.
